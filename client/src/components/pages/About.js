            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Kaemon Lovendahl. I'm a passionate developer that also loves playing MTG. This project was made as a way for me to keep track of my cards, decks, and my collection. I understand that many others have done the same thing. (Especially way better than my own) However, I thought it would be great to create my own answer to this problem.</p>
            <p>I would greatly appreciate it if you would send me any feedback, suggestions, or bugs!</p>
        </div>
